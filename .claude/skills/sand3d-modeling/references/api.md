# sand3d

`import sand3d as s3d`; mm, or `units("m")` first. Makers take a name, return the solid; edits return
it. Edges and faces go by their maker's names (top bottom side rim seam start end cut, tool names,
plate.top).

1. A placement is a frame plus values. `at` sets the values it is given and keeps the others; `on=`
   changes the frame, and x, y, z then run along its axes; `transform` moves the whole thing, as a parent
   would, mirror included.
2. To repeat, pass a list of frames to `on=`: once per frame, in `at`, `hole` and `pocket`.
3. A list of objects is worth its elements, wherever a verb takes objects.
4. What a verb uses up no longer exists. `copy` keeps it; always use what `at` returns.
5. Every solid starts at z = 0, centred in x and y: `box` is the `extrude` of its `rect`; `extrude(both=True)`
   centres one on its plane. A face's frame starts where the origin projects onto it: a vertical face's, at
   its foot. A frame's Z is the face's normal; on a face whose normal is ±Z its X is +X, on any other
   X is Z × normal: on a face looking +X, X is +Y and Y is up. A side, an edge or a corner of a box is
   named by directions: `bbox(ob, "+X")` is the centre of that side of its bounding box, `"+X-Y"` the
   middle of an edge, `"+X-Y+Z"` a corner, with the axes of a face looking the first way named, on a part
   or a group; `at`'s `anchor` takes the same ("-Z", "+Y-Z"; its words top bottom left right front back
   are +Z -Z -X +X -Y +Y).
6. A joint lets a part move on another. Place the part first: `joint` does not move it, it says how it
   moves — on the part its frame `on` was read on (`ob.face`, `bbox`, `local`, an assembly's anchor; it
   stays read on it through `.move`, `.turn`, `.offset`), about or along `axis`: a direction ("+Z", "-X"…)
   in the space the parent lives in, as in `face`, or "normal", `on`'s Z. A pivot given as numbers — a
   source's joint origin, xyz and rpy — is `local(parent, x, y, z, rx, ry, rz)`, in the parent's own space:
   `at(child, on=…)` places the child there, `joint` hangs it there. Positive values slide along the axis,
   or turn by the right hand about it: about +Z, +X turns toward +Y — a door hinged on the -Y edge of a +X
   face opens outward about "-Z". The range contains 0; a joint that follows another takes its range from
   it. Everything is built at rest, every joint at 0; `pose(child, value)` moves the mechanism. A part with
   no joint moves with its group; a jointed part moves by its joint, whatever group it is in; `on` is never
   read on the child itself. Joints may come before or after `group`/`assembly`. `copy` copies a jointed
   part's joints (it hangs on the same parent); `transform` moves the part with its pivot (a mirror image
   moves as the image of the motion); `at` refuses it. Two joints on one child compose in order (a screw: a
   turn, and a slide that follows it with `ratio=pitch / 360`).
